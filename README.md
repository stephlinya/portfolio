# what
Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website. I used HTML/SCSS/CSS and Figma to design and code my portfolio.
# why
I was on a short timeline and wanted to keep it as simple as possible. SCSS is great since it allows me to use nesting when I'm writing my styles.
# future things
I'd like to refactor the code with React in the future.
